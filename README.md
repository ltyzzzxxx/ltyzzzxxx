### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello guys, I'm Li Tianyu, but I always use ltyzzz as my username.ðŸ˜‹

I love programing (Java and Python3) and algorithm. Front end techs are also interesting such as React, Vue, mini-apps etc.

Recently, I'm learning Distributed System which I think is really cool and trendy.

I believe I can make it even though I'm programming noob now.
